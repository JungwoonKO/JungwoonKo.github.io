  <p>For this final project, I decided to participate in a "Rendering Competition" style project to render global illumination and caustics by implementing photon mapping. For this project, I referred to this paper: <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall18/cos526/papers/jensen01.pdf" target="_blank">Photon Mapping for Realistic Image Synthesis</a> and the video instruction: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odXCvJTNn6s&t=52s" target="_blank">Photon Mapping Video Tutorial</a>. I used the scene provided with the assignments and the skeleton code with Embree. First, I implemented refraction to render glass materials. The first photo shows direct light rendering, and the other two photos show indirect light using photon mapping. However, I couldn't figure out the indirect light completely. It seems pretty dim, and the caustics don't render correctly.</p>
